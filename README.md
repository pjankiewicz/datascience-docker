# datascience-docker

## Introduction ##

If you haven't used Docker before, a good place to start is the [Docker User Guide](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/).

### Setup ###

For those running a linux distro, you should be able to apt-get/yum docker. For those on OS X, you'll need to install boot2docker, which adds a virtual machine that docker will/can run in. [http://viget.com/extend/how-to-use-docker-on-os-x-the-missing-guide]("How to Use Docker on OS X: The Missing Guide") is a a good write up on the subject.

## Getting Started ##

The basic Python-centric image is hosted at the Docker Hub. You can grab it:

```
docker pull paweljankiewicz/datascience-docker
```
